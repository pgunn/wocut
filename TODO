Add rules used for better tracking packet flow to specific ports, as an
option.
	I've been thinking about this. RAW rules wouldn't do it; they happen
	too early in iptables. I think I could do it with INPUT rules, which
	happen just before the packets are delivered to local processes.

	I started to implement this. I need to hook it up to the interface.

	Update: Preparing code to parse this

Refactor dispatch_ functions into do_functions

Offer to remove the 9999 rule if no configs are running that use it. Only
install it as-needed.

Convert marks so they display the same in hex as what they're meant to
represent?

Global configs to a config file

Split this into modules. Dispatch and do_ functions don't belong in the
same file.

Python port. Library ports for both Perl and Python.

Clean up terminology on "service" versus the things we start.
